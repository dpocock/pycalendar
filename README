Flexible aggregation for iCalendar feeds (:RFC:`5545`).

The iCalender standard provides a common format for exchanging
calendar information.  This project aims to provide a library with a
clean API for aggregating and processing iCalendar feeds.  What you do
with that processed information is up to you.

There are a number of existing aggregators, ranging from the
closed-source `Google Calendar`_ to the open-source elmcity_ and
Calagator_.  However, I want a library that can work as an iCalendar
version of feedparser_, and `code for a web-frontend`__ is just dead
weight.
